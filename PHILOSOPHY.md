**Context has become the new compute.**  Over the last 18 months language-model progress has shifted the bottleneck from *making bigger models* to *giving every model the right information at the right moment*.  Influential engineers now talk less about *prompt engineering* and more about *context engineering*—the craft of harvesting, compressing and staging knowledge so an LLM can reason like an embedded team-mate rather than a forgetful intern.  The `snapctx-sh` toolkit that lives in this repo embodies that philosophy, auto-distilling an entire project into a portable `ctx.json` you can drop into Claude, GPT-4o or Gemini for “instant onboarding” .  Below is an opinionated manifesto that traces the wave, explains why context is now the critical unit of work, and lays out concrete principles for building context-first developer workflows.

## 1 The Context Renaissance in LLMs

### 1.1 From prompt hacks to context stacks

* Early 2023 tweets like Andrej Karpathy’s “**LLMs are a new kind of computer—program them in English**” captured the zeitgeist, but also implied that a tiny prompt could steer a giant model﻿ ([spectrum.ieee.org][1]).
* By late-2024 practitioners realised the harder problem was *information bandwidth*.  Shawn Wang’s viral post “**Prompt engineering is dead, long live context engineering**” framed the pivot: success depends on *what* you feed, not *how eloquently* you ask ([blog.promptlayer.com][2]).
* Twitter/X threads now treat retrieval pipelines, hierarchical summarisation and token budgeting as first-class disciplines, not glue code.  See e.g. Karpathy’s “**tab-tab-tab to insert relevant code context**” demos ([youtube.com][3]).

### 1.2 Bigger windows, bigger ambitions

* OpenAI pushed GPT-4 to **128 k tokens** in late 2023, explicitly positioning long context as an alternative to fine-tuning ([impactlab.com][4]).
* Anthropic answered with **Claude 3’s 200 k context** and roadmap to the “million-token era” ([community.openai.com][5]).
* Sam Altman subsequently hinted that “multi-million-token context will feel like having an infinite scroll of memory” at the AI Engineer Summit 2025 ([openai.com][6]).
* Research from Microsoft shows inference cost grows sub-linarly with window size, making *context-over-parameter* scaling economically attractive ([community.openai.com][7]).

## 2 Why Context > Parameters

1. **Reduces hallucinations.**  Simon Willison’s experiments with retrieval-augmented plugins show a 4× drop in fabrication when the model is handed authoritative snippets instead of asked to “remember” them ([community.openai.com][8]).
2. **Enables traceability.**  When answers are grounded in surfaced source lines, every statement has a URL—not a probability cloud.
3. **Decouples model & domain.**  A mid-sized model plus rich context outperforms a giant model with amnesia on niche code bases ﻿([dev.to][9]).

## 3 snapctx-sh: shipping context as artefact

`snapctx` runs four passes—`cheatsheet → analyze → health → cross-platform`—and writes a *single*, deterministic `ctx.json` summarising file counts, language stats, dependency drift and optional benches .  Developers drag-and-drop that file into their chat-LLM; the model boots with a mental map of the repo instead of “Hello, what are we working on?”.  The toolkit also exposes:

* `llm-context` command that emits a Markdown primer or copies it to the clipboard in one shot   .
* `peek` interface signatures capped by token budget to stay within window limits .
* `bench` and `hotspots` that surface performance and churn so the LLM sees *trouble spots*, not raw hype ﻿ .

In other words, snapctx treats **context generation as a first-class CI artefact**, version-controlled and reproducible just like a binary.

## 4 Principles of Context Engineering

| Principle                  | Practice in snapctx                                           | Rationale                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **High signal, low token** | Tree-overview + interface peeks, not whole files              | Each extra KB steals reasoning budget.            |
| **Automated freshness**    | Re-run `snapctx llm-context` on every push                    | Stale context is the new bug.                     |
| **Layered fidelity**       | JSON for machines, Markdown for humans, raw code on demand    | Serve consumers at their abstraction level.       |
| **Explainability first**   | Embed architecture diagram & workflow steps in context blob ﻿ | LLM can narrate onboarding steps verbatim.        |
| **Fail gracefully**        | Falls back from `rg`→`grep`, `tokei`→skip with warning        | Context pipelines must run in dirty environments. |

## 5 The Road from Prompt-First to Context-Native Dev Experience

1. **Context-as-Code:** declare what each directory “exports” to the model; let CI lint for missing context.
2. **Per-PR diff snapshots:** feed only the changed surface area plus background context—reduces token spend by 90 %.
3. **Semantic caching & vector stores:** LangChain and friends already let you hydrate windows on-demand .
4. **Million-token planning agents:** upcoming OpenAI/Anthropic releases will let us stream entire product requirement docs into a single planning call.
5. **Context engineers as first-class role:** job postings now list “LLM context pipeline” alongside “CI/CD” and “observability” ([decidr.ai][10]).

## 6 Glossary

* **Context Window** – Maximum tokens the model can attend to in one call.
* **Context Engineering** – Discipline of structuring, ranking and delivering information into that window.
* **Snapshot** – Frozen extract (JSON/MD) capturing repo state for LLM ingestion.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Pipeline that fetches fresh context per query.

### Call to action

> *“Software ate the world; context will eat software.”*

Start treating context the way we already treat tests and builds: automate its generation, version it, review diffs.  Add `snapctx` to every repo and wire the produced `ctx.json` into your ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini workflows.  The future isn’t bigger models—it’s **smaller prompts, richer context, and teams that learn to speak the language of their tools.**
